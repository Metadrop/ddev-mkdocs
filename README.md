## What is DDEV Mkdocs Add-on?

his repository provides a [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io) add-on for the [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) service, based on [Metadrop mkdocs docker image](https://github.com/Metadrop/docker-mkdocs).

MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

This addon just provides the basics to view mkdocs static site from docs/ folder on your project.

```shell
ddev add-on get Metadrop/ddev-mkdocs
```

For earlier versions of DDEV run

```

After that you need to restart the ddev project:

```shell

```
